•	../{output_directory_fastas}/mhc_ii/{Sample_Name}.peptides

•	../{output_directory_mapping_files}/{Sample_Name}.tsv
		Tab separated file containing the same results from step 2, but with an additional NetMHCpan id to match peptides to their corresponding isoform and junction event after running NetMHCpan

•	../{output_directory_netmhcpan_results}/{Sample_Name}.xlsoutput
		Tab separated output table from NetMHCPan containing binding affinity scores for every possible peptide at every provided junction for the sample

4. xls_parser.sh
•	{Sample_Name}.output:
		Tab separated output table containing the affinity scores for each allele for the highest binding peptide per isoform

5. get_phbr.sh / get_phbr_ROI.sh
•	fin_results.txt:
		Full tab separated results table of PHBR scores and corresponding peptide/isoform results for both the alternatively spliced junction event, and the corresponding wild-type where applicable. Lower PHBR values = higher binding affinity. This file contains all of the possible highest binding peptides and all of the trinity assembled isoforms per alternative splicing event

•	raw_results.txt:
		Same as the above, however contains a summarized tab separated results table with only the most commonly occuring peptide and isoform across the samples for each event

Results Files Column Descriptions
•	ASE_junction/ROI:
		Junction or Region of Interest Coordinates

•	Best_ASE_Peptide_HLA_Pair
		Strongest binding kmer/peptide found for the event, the HLA allele type to which it best binds to, and the NetMHCpan affinity score

•	ASE_peptide
		The highest binding kmer/peptide for each sample the junction/region of interest was found in

•	Average_ASE_PHBR_Score(s)
		For each event, a PHBR score is calculated using the harmonic mean of the NetMHCpan binding affinity scores, accounting for all possible HLA allele types in the tumor sample. From here, an Average PHBR score is calculated based on all of the PHBR scores for the event in the tumor samples.

•	ASE_PHBR_Score (raw results only)
		A list of PHBR scores for every sample for the event

•	ASE_#Reads (raw results only)
		A list of the total number of reads that spanned the junction/region of interest for each tumor sample

•	ASE_isoforms (raw results only)
		A list of the full isoform sequence assembled by Trinity for the junction/region of interest event for each tumor sample

•	Tumor_samples_with_junction
		List of tumor samples that were determined to have the junction/region event of interest with a potential neoantigen

•	%samples_with_ASE_junction
		Percentage of tumor samples that actually had the junction event and a potential neoantign

•	ASE_best_alleles
		The HLA alleles in each tumor sample that displayed the strongest ability to bind to the listed potential neoantigen

•	WT_junction
		Coordinates for the “wild-type” junction that shares a start or end site with the junction of interest.

•	WT_peptide
		The highest binding kmer/peptide formed in the normal samples as a result of the “wild-type” junction

•	Average_WT_PHBR_Score(s)
		Same as “Average_ASE_PHBR_Score(s)”. Note: PHBR is again calculated using the HLA types of the tumor samples, NOT the normal in this case. This is done to compare how the potential “wild-type” peptide would bind in a patient.

•	WT_best_alleles
		The HLA alleles in each tumor sample that displayed the strongest ability to bind to the listed “wild-type” peptide

•	Symbol
		The HUGO gene symbol that corresponds to the splicing event
