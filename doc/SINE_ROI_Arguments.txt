SINE Regions of Interest (ROI) Arguments:

main_ROI.sh	
 Arguments:
		-b
			Path to Tumor RNA BAM file aligned to the genome for a single sample
		-j
			New line separated list of regions of interest to evaluate. Column header line should begin with “ROI”
		-g
			Path to GTF annotation file
		-f
			Path to CDS fasta file
		-t
			Path to Trinity Singularity/Apptainer Image
		-o
			Path to ouput directory where results should be stored
		-p
			Path to the SINE directory
		-s
			Name of the sample being analyzed
		-l
			Integer specifying the minimum contig length for Trinity Fasta Output [OPTIONAL]
		-d
			Regions of interest file also contains a column named “Direction” with the corresponding strand direction (F: Forward, R: Reverse, U: Unknown) of each region [Optional]
		-r
			Integer specifying a multiplication factor for read duplication. In cases where Trinity is not able to assemble an isoform due to a lack of junction/ROI users are able to duplicate the total number of reads by this factor if desired. WARNING: Doing so will increase the false positive rate of an actual event. Additionally, users should be aware of the potential increase in runtime and diskspace required when using this argument [Optional]
   		-m
     			Data is from a mouse genome [Optional]

get_netmhcpan_ROI.sh
 Arguments:
		-i
			Path to a directory with a tumor subdirectory that contains isoform results from main_ROI.sh
		-f
			Path to an output directory to store fasta files of isoforms
		-m
			Path to an output directory to store isoform to NetMHCpan ID mapping files
		-o
			Path to an output directory to store NetMHCpan xlsoutput results
		-a
			Path to a tab-separated text file of MHC alleles to check peptide binding against for the sample. See {../examples/mhc_allele_table.txt} to see how the allele table should be formatted.
		-s
			Name of the sample being analyzed
		-p
			Path to the SINE directory	

xls_parser.sh
 Arguments:
		-i
			Path to a directory of NetMHCpan xlsoutput results files
		-f
			Path to the mhc_i subdirectory of fasta files containing the isoforms. The mhc_i subdirectory is located in the fasta output directory from get_netmhcpan_ROI.sh
		-o
			Path to a directory to store newly parsed affinity files
		-p
			Path to the SINE directory

get_phbr_ROI.sh
 Arguments:
		-i
			Path to a directory of isoforms generated from main_ROI.sh
		-a
			Path to a directory of allele affinity scores. The output directory from xls_parser.sh is the input directory here
		-m
			Path to a directory containing sample files with mapping IDs
   		-o
			Path to a directory to store the results tables
		-p
			Path to the SINE directory
